## **6. Link Validation**
The CLI has a built‑in tool to verify if your docs links are broken:

```bash
mint broken-links

```  [oai_citation:5‡acme-83ff5188.mintlify.app](https://acme-83ff5188.mintlify.app/development)

## **7. Deployment**
Once your site deploys successfully, you should see a confirmation message (like “All checks have passed”).  [oai_citation:6‡acme-83ff5188.mintlify.app](https://acme-83ff5188.mintlify.app/development)

## **8. Code Formatting**
For better editor support:

- **VSCode MDX extension** for syntax highlighting  
- **Prettier** for formatting MDX files  [oai_citation:7‡acme-83ff5188.mintlify.app](https://acme-83ff5188.mintlify.app/development)

## **9. Troubleshooting**
Common issues include:

- **Error about “sharp” module** — usually due to outdated Node  
  - Remove CLI: `npm remove -g mint`
  - Update Node to v19+
  - Reinstall CLI: `npm i -g mint`

- **General unknown errors** — sometimes fixed by deleting `~/.mintlify` and retrying.  [oai_citation:8‡acme-83ff5188.mintlify.app](https://acme-83ff5188.mintlify.app/development)
