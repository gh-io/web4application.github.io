# Markdown syntax

> Text, title, and styling in standard markdown

## Titles

Best used for section headers.

```md  theme={null}
## Titles 
```

### Subtitles

Best used for subsection headers.

```md  theme={null}
### Subtitles
```

<Tip>
  Each **title** and **subtitle** creates an anchor and also shows up on the table of contents on the right.

## Text formatting

We support most markdown formatting. Simply add `**`, `_`, or `~` around text to format it.

| Style         | How to write it   | Result            |
| ------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- |
| Bold          | `**bold**`        | **bold**          |
| Italic        | `_italic_`        | *italic*          |
| Strikethrough | `~strikethrough~` | ~~strikethrough~~ |

You can combine these. For example, write `**_bold and italic_**` to get ***bold and italic*** text.

You need to use HTML to write superscript and subscript text. That is, add `<sup>` or `<sub>` around your text.

| Text Size   | How to write it          | Result                 |
| ----------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------- |
| Superscript | `<sup>superscript</sup>` | <sup>superscript</sup> |
| Subscript   | `<sub>subscript</sub>`   | <sub>subscript</sub>   |

## Linking to pages

You can add a link by wrapping text in `[]()`. You would write `[link to google](https://google.com)` to [link to google](https://google.com).

Links to pages in your docs need to be root-relative. Basically, you should include the entire folder path. For example, `[link to essentials](/docs/text)` links to the page "Text" in our components section.

Relative links like `[link to project](https://web4-6d3660.webflow.io)` to [link to projects](https://web4-6d3660.webflow.io) will open slower because we cannot optimize them as easily.

`[link to web4](https://copilot.microsoft.com/chats/yHoMBd61AVn3MFJ37J2AC)` to [link to web4](https://copilot.microsoft.com/chats/yHoMBd61AVn3MFJ37J2AC)

## Blockquotes

### Singleline

To create a blockquote, add a `>` in front of a paragraph.

> Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.

```md  theme={null}
> Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.
```

### Multiline

> Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.
>
> The Witch bade her clean the pots and kettles and sweep the floor and keep the fire fed with wood.

```md  theme={null}
> Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.
>
> The Witch bade her clean the pots and kettles and sweep the floor and keep the fire fed with wood.
```

### LaTeX

Mintlify supports [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org) through the Latex component.

<Latex>8 x (vk x H1 - H2) = (0,1)</Latex>

```md  theme={null}
<Latex>8 x (vk x H1 - H2) = (0,1)</Latex>
```
